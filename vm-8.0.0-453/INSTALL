USING CONFIGURE
===============

0) If you get VM from the revision control, the ./configure script is
   not included. You have to run "autoconf" to create it.

1) Select your emacs flavor, this is the option --with-emacs and its
   default is emacs (GNU Emacs).  Choose a prefix for the installation
   with --prefix, by default /usr/local.

   The default locations are as follows:

   a) GNU Emacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/share/emacs/site-lisp and
      info files to ${prefix}/info (overridable with --with-lispdir=...
      and --infodir=...)

   b) XEmacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/lisp/vm and
      info files to ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/info, (overridable
      with --with-infodir=... and --infodir=...)

   ATTENTION: Files byte-compiled with GNU Emacs are NOT COMPATIBLE with the
   XEmacs and you may experience strange problems during startup when doing
   so.  Even between GNU Emacs versions there might be problems! Thus you must
   ensure you are configuring with --with-emacs=xemacs when installing VM for
   XEmacs!  Also if you want to use BBDB features please specify the path
   to its source files with the -with-other-dirs option. 

   a) GNU Emacs users run:
	./configure --with-other-dirs=/absolute/path/to/bbdb/lisp

   b) XEmacs+BBDB users run:
	./configure --with-emacs=xemacs --with-other-dirs=/absolute/path/to/bbdb/lisp

   It is possible to build VM in a separate directory. For instance, type

        mkdir build; cd build; ../configure

2) Compile everything by running:

	make

    You may ignore warnings, however error messages indicate that some modules
    (partially) will not work, i.e. if other library files are missing or you
    are running GNU Emacs.

3) Installing the files

   a) The manual way

       Add the lisp/info path as chosen above to the paths Emacs searches, 
       i.e. add the following to your ~/.emacs resp. ~/.xemacs/init.el (if you
       don't already have an equivalent)

         (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/lisp/build/dir")
         (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/the/info/dir"))

       GNU Emacs users, have to load the autloads by hand now by adding

         (require 'vm-autoloads)

       to their ~/.emacs.

       XEmacs: You are lucky nothing to do for you!

4) You are now ready to use VM.  C-h i should start up the Emacs Info
   system and if you have installed the Info documents properly you can
   use the online documentation to teach yourself how to use VM.
