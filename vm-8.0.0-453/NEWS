    | Yes.  Obviously I've moved on, though I've been slow to admit it
    | to myself.  Good luck.

    * My (robf) VM extensions are now activated by default, where it makes
      sense to me.

    * Releases are numbered now MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL, where MAJOR is
      increased when fundamental changes occur, MINOR for new features and
      PATCHLEVEL for bugfix releases.

    * New cleaner source tree layout.

    * Better built system based on configure.  Autoloads are generated only
      for those functions marked with the autoload token now, which are mainly
      interactive function. Thus, loading occurs only on demand and startup
      should be faster.
      
  BUGS:

    * All bugs reported to gnu.emacs.vm.bugs, gnu.emacs.vm.info and directly
      to me are fixed either by the patches posted by others or me.

    * If there are any missing autoloads, please report them and add a
      (require 'vm-SOURCE) to your ~/.vm!

    * Probably added numerous new bugs.


  IMPROVEMENTS: compared to 7.19 (not vmrf)

    * A new icon set based on vm-small-pixmaps.tgz which was floating around.
      This one should fit by height to the one used in XEmacs and Emacs 22,
      but it is slightly larger than those used in Emacs 21.  If you see the
      old icons, the please set the variables `vm-image-directory' and
      `vm-toolbar-pixmap-directory' to nil in your ~/.vm!

    * vm-mime-type-converter-alist now also works when replying to messages,
      i.e. for text/html one can use lynx or w3m for the conversion.
      (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
	'(("text/html" "text/plain" "lynx -force_html -dump /dev/stdin")))

    * Postponing (draft handling) of compositions and continuing of drafts, in
      fact any messages also those from other people. (Info node: Sending
      Messages) 

    * New mail header insertion functions for return-receipts, mail-priority
      and FCC.

    * More virtual folder selectors and replacements of other functions based
      on selectors. (Info node: Virtual Folders)

    * vm-serial.el provides message templates for composition and
      personalizes mass emails. (Info node: TODO)
    
    * vm-biff.el for popups with a list of new messages.

    * vm-rfaddons.el has various stuff, look at the source if you are curious
      or miss some VM feature, as it might already be there!
